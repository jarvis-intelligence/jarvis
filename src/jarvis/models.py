"""Plain dataclasses for the nav-tool result shapes.

Trimmed from an internal reference implementation's pydantic `models.py` (that file also
carries FastAPI/registration/stats/blast-radius models jarvis doesn't
need). Dataclasses instead of pydantic here: MCP tool functions in
`server.py` return dicts built from these directly (`dataclasses.asdict`),
and jarvis has no HTTP layer that would benefit from pydantic validation.
