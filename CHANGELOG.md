# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-31

### Fixed

- `codeintel index` picked the wrong language for a repo whenever a gitignored
  scratch directory (vendored checkouts, sibling clones, `.worktrees/`) held
  more files than the repo's own tracked code — `detect_language()` walked the
  filesystem (`rglob`) and counted those files too. Detection now counts
  `git ls-files` output instead, so only the repo's own tracked files vote.
  `IGNORED_DIRS` filtering is still applied on top, since git alone doesn't
  exclude build output a repo happens to commit.
- A non-git directory now raises a clear `NotAGitRepositoryError` instead of
  silently walking the filesystem or failing with an unrelated message.
- A git repo with no commits now raises `IndexingError` naming the cause,
  instead of a raw, unhelpful `CalledProcessError`.

### Added

- `--language <name>` flag on `codeintel index` and `codeintel watch`, to
  force the indexer language instead of detecting it — for genuinely
  polyglot repos where file plurality isn't the language you want indexed.
  Persisted in the registry and reused automatically by `reindex`/`watch`,
  matching the existing `--scheme` override.
